## ❌ **Error:** "You do not have access to this app or it does not exist"

This error typically means one of these issues:

### **🔍 Possible Causes:**

1. **❌ App deployment failed** - The app didn't deploy successfully
2. **❌ Repository access** - Streamlit can't access your GitHub files

## 🛠️ **Step-by-Step Fix:**

### **Step 1: Check Your Streamlit Cloud Dashboard**
1. Go to **[share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)**
2. **Sign in with GitHub** (same account you used)
3. **Check your apps list** - Is the app showing?
4. **Look for error messages** - Red error indicators?

### **Step 2: Verify GitHub Repository**
1. Go to **https://github.com/hhamilNY/Python**
2. **Check if these files exist:**
   - ✅ `mobile_earthquake_app.py`
   - ✅ `requirements.txt`
3. **Files missing?** → Upload them again

### **Step 3: Redeploy the App**
If the app isn't working, let's create a fresh deployment:

1. **Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)**
2. **Click "New app"**
3. **Repository:** `hhamilNY/Python`
4. **Branch:** `main`
5. **Main file path:** `mobile_earthquake_app.py`
6. **App URL:** Choose a custom name like `earthquake-monitor-app`
7. **Click "Deploy!"**

## 🔧 **Alternative Solutions:**

### **Option A: New Repository (Clean Start)**
Create a dedicated repository just for the earthquake app:

1. **Create new repo:** `earthquake-monitor`
2. **Upload only these files:**
   - `mobile_earthquake_app.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `README.md` (optional)
3. **Deploy from new repo**

### **Option B: GitHub Codespaces (Quick Fix)**
1. **Go to your GitHub repo**
2. **Click "Code" → "Codespaces" → "Create codespace"**
3. **Run in terminal:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run mobile_earthquake_app.py --server.port=8501
   ```
4. **Make port public** when prompted
5. **Share the public URL**

### **Option C: Local Network (Backup)**
We can try fixing the local network issue:
```powershell
# Try different port
uv run streamlit run mobile_earthquake_app.py --server.port=8080 --server.address=0.0.0.0

# Or use mobile hotspot
# Connect both devices to your phone's hotspot
```

## 🎯 **Most Likely Solution:**

The app probably failed to deploy due to:
- **Missing requirements.txt** in the right location
- **Wrong file path** specified during deployment
- **Repository access issues**

**Let's try redeploying with the correct settings!**

1. **Check [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)** - Do you see your app?
2. **Check GitHub** - Are the files uploaded?
3. **Try redeploying** - Create new app from same repo?
