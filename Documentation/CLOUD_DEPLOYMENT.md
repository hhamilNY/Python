# 🌐 Deploy Your Earthquake Monitor to the Cloud

Since local network access isn't working, let's get your app online where anyone can access it!

## 🚀 **Streamlit Cloud Deployment (FREE & EASY)**

### **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in (or create account)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it: `earthquake-monitor`
4. Make it **Public**
5. Click "Create repository"

### **Step 2: Upload Your Files**
Upload these files to your GitHub repository:
- `mobile_earthquake_app.py` ← Your mobile app
- `requirements.txt` ← Dependencies (I just updated this)
- `README.md` ← Description (optional)

### **Step 3: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**
1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Click "Sign in with GitHub"
3. Click "New app"
4. Select your `earthquake-monitor` repository
5. Choose `mobile_earthquake_app.py` as the main file
6. Click "Deploy!"

### **Step 4: Share Your Public URL**
You'll get a public URL like:
`https://earthquake-monitor-abc123.streamlit.app`

**Anyone in the world can access this URL!** 🌍

## 🏃‍♂️ **Quick Alternative: GitHub Codespaces**

If you want it running in 2 minutes:

1. **Push code to GitHub** (same as above)
2. **Open GitHub Codespaces** on your repository
3. **Run**: `streamlit run mobile_earthquake_app.py`
4. **Click "Make Public"** when the port forwarding dialog appears
5. **Share the public URL** with your friend

## 📱 **Or Try This Local Fix:**

Sometimes router settings block connections. Try:

```powershell
# Run Streamlit on a different port
uv run streamlit run mobile_earthquake_app.py --server.port=8080 --server.address=0.0.0.0
```

Then your friend tries: `http://192.168.1.217:8080`

## 🎯 **Why Local Network Failed:**

Local network access can fail due to:
- 🔒 **Router security** blocking device-to-device communication
- 📱 **Mobile data** instead of WiFi
- 🌐 **Different network segments** (guest vs main network)
- 🔥 **ISP firewall** blocking local connections
- 📡 **WiFi isolation** enabled on router

**Cloud deployment solves ALL these issues!** ☁️
