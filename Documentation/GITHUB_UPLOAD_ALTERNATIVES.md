# üì§ GitHub File Upload - Different Methods

## üîç **Can't Find "Add files"? Try These:**

### **Method 1: Look for Different Button Names**
GitHub might show different text:
- **"Upload files"** (instead of "Add files")
- **"Create new file"** (to create manually)
- **"+"** symbol (plus button)
- **"Add file"** (singular, not plural)

**Where to look:**
- Near the green **"Code"** button
- Above the file list in your repository
- Sometimes in a dropdown menu

### **Method 2: Direct URL Method**
1. **Go to:** https://github.com/hhamilNY/Python/upload
2. **This takes you directly to upload page**
3. **Drag and drop your files**

---

### **Method 3: Create Files Manually**
If upload isn't working, we can copy/paste the content:

#### **Step A: Create mobile_earthquake_app.py**
1. **Go to:** https://github.com/hhamilNY/Python
2. **Click "Create new file"** (or "+" button)
3. **File name:** `mobile_earthquake_app.py`
4. **Copy/paste the entire content** (I'll provide below)

#### **Step B: Create requirements.txt**
1. **Create another new file**
2. **File name:** `requirements.txt`
3. **Copy/paste requirements** (I'll provide below)

### **Method 4: GitHub Desktop App**
1. **Download GitHub Desktop** (if you don't have it)
2. **Clone your repository**
3. **Copy files to local folder**
4. **Commit and push**

---

### **Method 5: Command Line (Advanced)**
If you're comfortable with git commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hhamilNY/Python.git
cd Python
# Copy your files here
git add .
git commit -m "Add earthquake app"
git push
```

---

## üìã **Content to Copy/Paste (If Using Method 3):**

### **For mobile_earthquake_app.py:**
```python
# I'll provide the full content here if needed
```

### **For requirements.txt:**
```
streamlit>=1.28.0
plotly>=5.17.0
pandas>=2.0.0
requests>=2.31.0
numpy>=1.24.0
matplotlib>=3.10.7
```

## üîç **Troubleshooting GitHub Interface:**

### **Can't See Upload Option?**
- **Check if you're signed in** to GitHub
- **Make sure you're on YOUR repository** (hhamilNY/Python)
- **Try refreshing the page**
- **Try different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- **Check if repository is private** (might affect options)

### **Repository Permissions:**
- Make sure you **own the repository**
- Check you're not on someone else's fork
- Verify you have **write access**

## üöÄ **Fastest Solution:**

**Try this direct URL:** https://github.com/hhamilNY/Python/upload

If that doesn't work, let me know what you see on your GitHub repository page and I'll help you find the right button or use an alternative method!

## üì± **Alternative: Use GitHub Web Editor**
1. **Go to:** https://github.com/hhamilNY/Python
2. **Press "." (period key)** on your keyboard
3. **This opens GitHub's web editor**
4. **Create new files** and paste content
5. **Commit changes**
